# Cartman Sound Board

A fun sound board application with quotes by Cartman from the hit TV show South Park.

## Description

This is a simple sound board where the user can press letter keys to hear a Cartman Quote of their choice. It is built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

## Getting Started
Using this app is as easy as hitting a letter key to play a sound. So far the letters Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, and I are all associated with audio files.

### Dependencies

So, far this app works in Chrome. More programming would be needed for cross browser compatibility. Other than that there are no other dependancies needed to use the sound board.

### Installing

* This repository can be easily cloned since there are no special installations or modification needed:
